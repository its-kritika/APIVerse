<h2 align="center">New API v/s Existing API</h2>

<div style="color : red">

📌New API is the one where all the endpoints are defined by you and there is no integration of any API that's already existing.

📌Existing API means that there is an API that is already existing, you are just fetching data and displaying it from external source.<br>

<h2 align="center">🚀When you can expect your PR will get accepted?</h2>

<div style="color : red">
<i><b>
 ✅ You should add either 1 new API or 1 existing APIafter testing the code properly. The file structure should be followed. README.md file should be present inside your folder. <br>
 ✅If you are contributing towards enhancement of any API, you need to make sure that you are enhancing atleast 2 APIs. <br>
 ✅If you are contributing towards any documentation related bug, you should solve atleast 5 documentation bugs to get your PR merged. <br>

### Note : For existing API, You should submit the corresponding html and css files also so that we can better visualise how this API can be used within projects. Only submitting JS files won't work.
